# About Shellshock

An *Arbitrary Code Execution*-vulnerability

* Introduced 1989, discovered 2014

* Parser-bug
- Bash executed trailing code after function definitions

```bash
VAR=() { ignored; }; /bin/id
```

Malicious code can be injected into environment variables!

???

Introduced: 5 august 1989

Discovered: 12 semptember 2014

# Shellshock and HTTP

* HTTP header fields are often stored in environment variables
- which means they are Shellshock vulnerable

* Can be used to run arbritary code through Bash
- simply by crafting special HTTP headers

* CGI scripts using Bash is a common attack vector

```
www.example.com/test.cgi:
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo -e "Content-type: text/html\n\n"
echo "Hello, $HTTP_USER_AGENT"
```

# Exploitation

We exploited the vulnerability in two ways

* Using a Metasploit auxiliary module
- apache_mod_cgi_bash_env

* Using the **curl** command line tool

```
curl -A "() { :; }; <payload>" <target-url>
```

on a server running a vulnerable version of Bash and Debian

???

Bash v4.1.5

Debian v 6.0.10

# Mitigation

Mitigated by updating Bash

* The first patches came 12 days after discovery, same day as public release
- A final patch was released 15 days after discovery

* Bash version 4.3 and onward are not vulnerable

&nbsp;

1.5 million attacks per day were performed when the patch was released
