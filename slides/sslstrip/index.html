# About SSLStrip
A Man-in-the-middle protocol downgrade attack tool from 2009.

* Intercepts starting HTTPS connections between client and server.

* Tricks client into using insecure connection for sensitive data.

* Logs intercepted traffic.

# Results

Running on my home network, I managed to

* sniff user credentials in plaintext
    - from previously secure connections!

* intercept user credentials from 3 active sites.

# Mitigation (HSTS)

HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

* Introduced to mitigate SSLStrip

* A special responce header field

* Declares that a web server will *always* use HTTPS in the future

Note that

* it's not always used

* it needs to be preloaded in the browser
    - or an attacker can intercept the first HSTS message

*Be specific about requesting HTTPS!*

# Summary

* SSLStrip can easily intercept HTTPS traffic

    - invisibly for the server
    - discreetly for the client

* HSTS can mitigate the attack

    - preferably preloaded

* Make sure your connections are encrypted on open networks
